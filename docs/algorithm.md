# Theory & algorithm internals

How LDpred3 turns GWAS summary statistics into polygenic-score weights — the
statistical **model and its samplers first**, then the LD representations, priors
and performance levers layered on top. For a task-oriented walkthrough see
[guide.md](guide.md); for the measured behaviour, [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md).

**Theory:** [the model](#the-model) · [infinitesimal](#the-infinitesimal-model) ·
[point-normal & the Gibbs sampler](#the-point-normal-model-and-its-gibbs-sampler)
· [auto: estimating h²/p](#ldpred3-auto-estimating-h-and-p). Everything after that
is internals (LD options, priors, the other methods, performance) built on this
core.

## The model

LDpred3 works entirely from **summary statistics** — each variant's marginal GWAS
effect and an LD (correlation) matrix — never individual genotypes. All effects
are on the **standardized scale**: genotypes are mean-centred and scaled to unit
variance and the phenotype likewise, so a marginal effect `β̂_j` is the
correlation between standardized SNP `j` and the trait (`standardize_betas` maps
reported per-allele effects onto this scale, `β̂ ≈ z/√N`, and returns the
back-transform).

The generative model tying the reported marginal effects `β̂` (length `m`) to the
true **joint** effects `β` is the LDpred2 sampling model:

    β̂ = R β + ε,        ε ~ N(0, R / N)

`R` is the `m×m` SNP correlation matrix (`R_jj = 1`) and `N` the GWAS sample size
(per-variant `N_j` allowed). Read it as: each marginal effect is the true effect
**plus the LD-weighted spillover from every correlated variant** (`Rβ`), inside
noise whose covariance is itself `R/N`. Recovering `β` from `β̂` — undoing that
spillover — is the whole task; the naive PRS uses `β̂` directly and so counts
every causal signal once for each variant in LD with it.

**Bayesian PRS: one likelihood, different priors.** Given a prior on `β`, the
posterior mean `E[β | β̂]` is the minimum-MSE set of PRS weights. Every LDpred3
model shares the likelihood above and differs *only* in the **prior** on the
effects — that single choice is what separates the methods:

| model | prior on `β_j` | estimator | function |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| infinitesimal (`inf`) | `N(0, h²/m)` — every variant causal | closed-form ridge | `ldpred3_inf` |
| point-normal (`grid`/`auto`) | `p·N(0, h²/mp) + (1−p)·δ₀` — spike-and-slab | Gibbs posterior mean | `ldpred3_grid` / `ldpred3_auto` |
| Bayesian lasso (`laplace`) | `Laplace(λ)` — heavy tail, no spike | Gibbs posterior mean | `ldpred3_laplace` |
| lasso (`lassosum2`) | `Laplace(λ)` | posterior **mode** (L1) | `lassosum2` |

`h²` is the SNP heritability and `p` the causal fraction. The spike-and-slab is
the workhorse — a point mass at zero (most variants do nothing) plus a Gaussian
slab for the causal few; `inf` is its `p=1` limit, and `laplace`/`lassosum2`
replace the spike with a continuous heavy tail (the **mean** vs the **mode** of
the same Laplace prior).

## The infinitesimal model

With a Gaussian prior `β ~ N(0, (h²/m) I)` the prior and likelihood are conjugate,
so the posterior mean is closed-form — the ridge / BLUP solution:

    β_inf = ( R + (m / (N h²)) I )⁻¹ β̂

The ridge `m/(Nh²)` is the prior-to-noise variance ratio: more variants or lower
heritability → stronger shrinkage toward zero. Dense `R` is solved directly
(`O(m³)`); a banded `SparseLD` is solved by conjugate gradient (matrix–vector
products only), and a `LowRankLD` by the Woodbury identity (`O(m·r + r³)`) — no
dense factorisation. It has no sampler and is the cheapest, most robust baseline,
but an all-variants-causal prior leaves accuracy on the table for any trait with
concentrated signal.

## The point-normal model and its Gibbs sampler

The spike-and-slab prior — with probability `p` a variant is causal with effect
`N(0, c)`, slab variance `c = h²/(mp)`; otherwise exactly zero — has no
closed-form posterior, so it is fit with a **Gibbs sampler** that resamples one
SNP at a time from its *exact* full conditional.

Hold every other effect fixed and form SNP `j`'s **residualised** marginal effect
— its `β̂_j` with the LD spillover from all the *other* current effects removed:

    r_j = β̂_j − (Rβ)_j + β_j = β̂_j − Σ_{k≠j} R_jk β_k

(the `+β_j` adds its own term back, since `R_jj = 1`). Under the model `r_j` is
then a clean noisy read of `β_j` alone, `r_j | β_j ~ N(β_j, 1/N_j)`. Combining
that with the slab gives, **for a causal effect**, a Gaussian conditional
posterior

    posterior variance   v = c / (N_j c + 1)
    posterior mean       μ = N_j · v · r_j

and the **probability the SNP is causal** is its Bayes factor against the null
(effect ≡ 0):

    log-odds(null : causal) = log((1−p)/p) + ½·log(1 + N_j c) − ½·μ²/v
    postp = P(causal | ·) = 1 / (1 + exp(log-odds))

Each sweep draws every SNP: with probability `postp` set `β_j ← μ + √v · z`
(`z ~ N(0,1)`), else `β_j ← 0`; when the effect changes it does a rank-1 update of
the maintained `Rβ`, so the next SNP's `r_j` is an `O(1)` lookup rather than a
fresh matrix–vector product. That `postp` **is** a posterior inclusion
probability — the exact quantity fine-mapping reports as a PIP (`ldpred3_pip`).

**Rao–Blackwellised estimate.** The returned weight for SNP `j` is not the average
*sampled* effect but the average of its conditional expectation
`E[β_j | rest] = postp · μ` over the post-burn-in sweeps (as in the original
LDpred). Same target, much lower Monte-Carlo variance, so far fewer iterations
reach a given accuracy (see [Performance](#performance--numba)). `sparse=True`
instead averages the hard-thresholded sampled effects to keep the result sparse.
`ldpred3_grid` runs this at **fixed** `(h², p)` — exact for the model, but you
must supply the hyper-parameters (or grid-search them on a validation cohort).

## LDpred3-auto: estimating h² and p

`ldpred3_auto` removes the tuning cohort by resampling `h²` and `p` **inside** the
sampler, each from its own conditional (LDpred2-auto), so the whole fit needs no
held-out data:

- **`p`** — with a `Beta(1, 1)` prior, its conditional given the current causal
  count `k` is `p ~ Beta(1 + k, 1 + m − k)`, drawn once per sweep.
- **`h²`** — the genetic variance of the current effects, `h² = βᵀRβ`, read
  straight off the maintained `Rβ` (no extra matrix product) and clamped to
  `h2_bounds` for stability.

Their post-burn-in means are the reported `h²`/`p`; the effects are the same
Rao–Blackwellised average as `grid`. Because the `p` update assumes a *single*
shared inclusion probability, non-uniform `prior_weights` are rejected here (use
`grid`, or the learned map in
[Learning the annotation map](#learning-the-annotation-map-sbayesrc)). Estimating
`h²`/`p` **globally** across all blocks rather than per block is what keeps auto
accurate at genome scale — the subject of the next section.

## Global hyper-parameters for `-auto`

`ldpred3_by_blocks(method="auto")` estimates `h2` and `p` **globally** by default
(`global_hyper=True`): the sampler **streams the LD blocks one at a time** (a
jitted per-block sweep), pooling the causal count and genetic variance across all
variants each iteration (as in bigsnpr). Estimating them per block instead
(`global_hyper=False`) is noisy when blocks hold few causal variants and **loses
accuracy at genome scale**. Streaming keeps the fast dense contiguous update,
has a constant-N fast path, and — critically — never materialises a packed
genome-wide LD matrix, so peak memory is just the LD plus O(m) state. At **2M
SNPs** this brought global auto from 137 s / 11.4 GB (packed) down to
**21 s / 0.34 GB** (~6× faster, ~34× less memory). On a 1M-SNP simulation
(block-diagonal LD, p=0.001, vs R `bigsnpr`):

| `-auto` variant | predictive R² | bigsnpr |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| global (default) | **0.941** | 0.942 |
| per block | 0.848 | 0.942 |

`inf` and `grid` already match bigsnpr (0.080/0.080 and 0.942/0.942 in the same
run); global hyper-parameters bring `-auto` to parity too.

## Optimal LD block splitting

Fixed-size LD blocks cut arbitrarily through high-LD regions. `optimal_ld_blocks`
implements [Privé (2022), *Bioinformatics*](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab519)
(`snp_ldsplit`): a dynamic program that places boundaries to **minimise the
squared LD discarded between blocks**, subject to a maximum block size — so cuts
land in low-LD valleys (recombination hotspots).

```python
blocks, discarded_ld2 = optimal_ld_blocks(corr, max_size=1000, window=300)
```

On a simulated chromosome with recombination hotspots (within-300 LD window):

| scheme | max block | LD retained |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| fixed 500 | 500 | 87.7 % |
| optimal (max 500) | 499 | **94.4 %** |
| fixed 1000 | 1000 | 94.6 % |
| optimal (max 1000) | 900 | **97.7 %** |

Optimal blocks discard less than half the LD of fixed blocks of the same size —
and `optimal(max 500)` retains as much LD as `fixed(1000)`, i.e. the same fidelity
at half the block size (≈4× less per-block O(k²) work and memory). The downstream
prediction gain is modest; the win is mainly computational/validity, as in the
paper.

## Sparse / banded LD

Real LD is banded — most off-diagonal entries are ~0 — so the LD can be stored
sparse (CSR) and the sampler/solver need only touch non-zero neighbours
(O(bandwidth) instead of O(block_size)). Build a `SparseLD` with `sparsify_ld`
and pass it to any model (or `ldpred3_by_blocks(..., sparsify=True)`):

```python
from ldpred3 import sparsify_ld, ldpred3_inf, ldpred3_auto
ld = sparsify_ld(corr, threshold=1e-3)        # drop |r| < 1e-3 (and/or max_dist=…)
beta = ldpred3_inf(ld, beta_hat, n_eff, h2)   # sparse CG solve; samplers also accept ld
```

On a clean population AR(1) block (m=4000, 0.47 % density) this gives, with
**identical results** (r = 1.000):

| method | dense | sparse | speedup |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| inf  | 2.77 s | 0.006 s | **444×** (CG vs dense O(m³) solve) |
| grid | 0.131 s | 0.070 s | 1.9× |
| auto | 0.138 s | 0.071 s | 1.9× |

At genome / sequencing scale (millions of SNPs, thousands per block) *all* blocks
are held in RAM, so persistent storage = Σ kᵦ² for dense blocks (≈160 GB for 10M
SNPs in 4000-blocks). `compute_ld_blocks(sparse=True, max_dist=w)` stores each
block banded (built dense transiently, then discarded), and the streaming auto
sampler fits `SparseLD` blocks directly via a CSR per-sweep kernel
(`_gibbs_one_sweep_sparse`) — so the accurate global-hyper fit runs at
O(k·bandwidth). The on-disk LD cache (`--ld-out` / `--ld-cache`) also stores the
CSR. Enable end-to-end with `--ld-sparse` (`--ld-max-dist w`).

**Banding is only lossless when LD really is short-range.** On realistic LD it is
**not**: banding discards genuine long-range structure. Measured on coalescent LD
(m=6000, 1000-SNP blocks; `benchmarks/ld_memory_scaling.py`,
`benchmarks/ld_shrink_large_blocks.py`):

| representation | genetic R² | memory |
|----------------|-----------:|-------:|
| dense | 0.992 | 100% |
| band w200 | 0.823 | 72% |
| **low-rank (PCs), 99.5% var** | **0.993** | **24%** |

So for realistic / sequencing-scale LD, **low-rank (eigen/PC) compression is the
right memory tool** — it matches dense accuracy at ~4× compression where banding
both loses accuracy and compresses less (SBayesRC's representation). This is
implemented: `compute_ld_blocks(lowrank=True, lowrank_variance=…)` (CLI
`--ld-lowrank`) stores each block as a `LowRankLD` (`R ≈ U Uᵀ`, unit diagonal,
top eigenvectors), and the global-hyper streaming auto sampler fits it **in the
r-dimensional eigenspace** via `_gibbs_one_sweep_lowrank`: it carries the block
residual as `s = Uᵀβ` (length r), recovers `(Rβ)_j = U[j]·s`, updates `s += Δ·U[j]`
on each effect change (O(r)), and uses `βᵀRβ = ‖s‖²` — so the fit is O(k·r) in
time and memory with no dense k×k. `ldpred3_inf` solves `LowRankLD` via Woodbury,
and the on-disk cache stores the `U` factor. Banding remains useful for genuinely
banded LD (e.g. AR(1)-like / some array data), and recombination-aware splitting
(`optimal_ld_blocks`) keeps blocks bounded regardless.

### On-disk LD streaming (`--ld-stream`)

Even compact blocks are all held in RAM by default. `save_ld_blocks(..., mmap=True)`
(pipeline `--ld-out --ld-stream`) writes the block payloads into one
memory-mappable `<cache>.dat.npy` sidecar; a later `--ld-cache` run then loads
each block as a **memmap view**, and the streaming sampler reads one block at a
time. Semantics to be precise about:

* The LD is **file-backed**, not on the Python heap — so it is **reclaimable
  under memory pressure and shareable across processes**, and an LD that exceeds
  RAM still runs (the OS pages it). Fits are bit-identical to the in-RAM path.
* On a machine with ample free RAM the OS caches all pages, so *resident* memory
  is similar to in-RAM — the benefit is enabling data > RAM and avoiding a
  per-process heap copy, not a smaller RSS when memory is plentiful.

Build once (ideally with `lowrank=True` to keep the cache small), then reuse it
cheaply across runs/cohorts: `--ld-out cache.npz --ld-stream` then
`--ld-cache cache.npz`. Supports dense and low-rank caches.

Two more caveats:

* **In-sample LD has a noise floor (~1/√N)** that fills the matrix, so magnitude
  thresholding alone won't sparsify it — band by distance (`max_dist=`) to drop
  the spurious far-apart entries, as LDpred2/bigsnpr do.
* **Hard banding can break positive-definiteness**, which destabilises the
  *fixed-h² sampler* (`grid` can diverge; `auto` self-limits via its h² clamp;
  `inf`'s ridge is unaffected). Use `sparsify_ld(..., shrink=<1)` to restore
  diagonal dominance, or supply an already-valid windowed LD matrix.

## Size-aware LD shrinkage (finite reference panels)

A block's sample LD estimated from `n_ref` reference individuals carries noise
that grows with the block size `k` relative to `n_ref` (Marchenko–Pastur: the
sample eigenvalues spread/inflate as `k/n_ref` grows). Small blocks
(`k ≪ n_ref`) are well estimated; **large blocks (`k` approaching or exceeding
`n_ref`) are noise-dominated**, and that noise makes the Gibbs sampler over-fit
and inflate `h²`.

`shrink_ld_blocks(blocks, n_ref)` (pipeline `--ld-shrink`) shrinks each block
toward the identity by `alpha = min(max_shrink, k/n_ref)` —
`R ← (1-alpha)·R + alpha·I`, diagonal kept 1 — so **large blocks are regularised
while small, well-estimated ones are left essentially untouched**. This is a
*uniform eigenvalue shrinkage* (`λ → (1-alpha)λ + alpha`).

A note on the spectral alternatives we tried (see
`benchmarks/ld_shrink_large_blocks.py`): on a finite panel,

* **PC truncation** (keep the top eigenvectors to a variance threshold, à la a
  naive low-rank LD) does **not** help as a drop-in — it preserves the
  Marchenko–Pastur-*inflated* top eigenvalues and, when `k < n_ref`, discards
  real signal directions.
* **RMT eigenvalue clipping** (flatten the noise bulk below the MP edge) helps,
  but **less** than the simpler size-aware shrinkage above.

so the shipped lever is the size-aware shrinkage. (Capturing SBayesRC's full PC
benefit would mean running the sampler in the *eigenspace* with a low-rank
likelihood rather than reconstructing `R̃` for the existing sampler — a larger
change, not yet implemented.)

## Fewer iterations: warm start & adaptive stopping

`ldpred3_grid`/`ldpred3_auto` accept:

* `warm_start=True` — initialise the chain from the LDpred3-inf solution instead
  of zeros, shortening burn-in. It pays for one `inf` solve up front, so it only
  helps when burn-in/mixing dominates **and** inf is cheap — i.e. paired with the
  sparse LD backend (CG inf). With a *dense* O(m³) inf solve it can cost more
  than it saves.
* `tol=<x>` (+ `check_every`) — **adaptive stopping**: end sampling once the
  running posterior mean's relative RMS change over `check_every` sweeps drops
  below `tol`, instead of always running `num_iter`. `AutoResult.n_iter` reports
  how many sweeps were used. On a fast-mixing block this reached the same
  accuracy as a fixed 2000-iteration run in ~100 iterations (~10× faster), with
  no loss (corr 1.000 vs the long run).

## Per-variant priors (annotation-informed, SBayesRC-style)

`ldpred3_grid` / `ldpred3_auto` accept `prior_weights` — a per-SNP relative
causal propensity from functional annotations. Each SNP's causal probability
becomes `p_j = p · prior_weights[j]` (clamped to `(0,1)`); with mean-1 weights
the expected causal count and `h²` stay coherent. SNPs in functionally
important regions (coding, conserved, enhancers, …) thus get a higher prior of
being causal — the core idea of SBayesRC.

```python
ldpred3_grid(corr, beta_hat, n_eff, h2, p, prior_weights=w)   # w_j >= 0, mean ~1
```

This injects **new information**, so unlike a change of slab shape it can
genuinely raise accuracy — but only when the annotations are trustworthy:

- **Informative** weights raise held-out R² (the gain grows as power drops, when
  more SNPs are borderline). On a single binary annotation in simulation the
  lift is small (~1–2% relative); SBayesRC's larger real-data gains come from
  many S-LDSC-calibrated annotations at genome scale.
- **Misleading / uninformative** weights *lower* accuracy, more so at low power.
  It is a "garbage-in" feature.
- Equal weights reproduce the uniform-`p` point-normal model bit-for-bit.

Only the inclusion probability is re-weighted here; the slab *variance* is left
global. Scaling the effect-size variance by annotation is a further knob, but it
must match a real annotation–effect-size relationship or it over-shrinks (it
hurt in simulations where effect size was annotation-independent).

### MAF-dependent slab variance (`alpha`)

A second, *allele-frequency*-based knob scales each variant's slab **variance**
(not its inclusion probability) by `[2f(1-f)]^(1+alpha)`, where `f` is the allele
frequency. This is the LDpred2-auto `alpha`/`use_MLE` prior of
[Privé et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.10.010): it relaxes the
standard-genotype assumption that per-allele effect variance is exactly
proportional to `1/[2f(1-f)]` (i.e. `alpha = -1`, the default and the original
point-normal model). Real traits often prefer `alpha` somewhere in `[-1, -0.5]`,
putting relatively more variance on common variants.

```python
ldpred3_grid(corr, beta_hat, n_eff, h2, p, af=freq, alpha=-0.5)   # auto / grid
run_ldpred3_prs(sumstats, plink, method="auto", alpha=-0.5)        # or --alpha
```

- `alpha = -1` (default) leaves the sampler bit-for-bit unchanged — the weights
  are mean-normalised so the total `h²` budget is preserved.
- It is a change of slab *shape* only, so — unlike annotation priors — it injects
  no new information; it helps only when the true effect–MAF coupling departs from
  `alpha = -1`. Privé et al. select it by maximising the model's own likelihood
  across a small `alpha` grid; here it is a user-set knob.
- Runs through the dense per-block `auto` / `grid` path only (it forces
  `global_hyper=False` for `auto`); not supported with the multi-chain auto
  estimator, `lassosum2`, `annot`, or compact (sparse / low-rank) LD.

### Learning the annotation map (SBayesRC)

`ldpred3_auto_annot` learns the annotation→prior map *inside* the sampler, so
the weights need not be supplied: each SNP's causal probability is
`p_j = sigmoid(a_jᵀθ)` and `θ` is updated jointly with the effects. Two
strategies (`learn=`):

* **`"eb"`** — empirical-Bayes: a ridge-regularised logistic (Newton/IRLS) step
  on the posterior inclusion probabilities. NumPy-only, fast, stable.
* **`"probit"`** — fully Bayesian: a probit link with Albert–Chib (1993) data
  augmentation (vectorised normal CDF / inverse-CDF), giving a conjugate
  Gaussian draw of `θ`.

```python
from ldpred3 import ldpred3_auto_annot
res = ldpred3_auto_annot(corr, beta_hat, n_eff, annotations=A, learn="eb")
res.beta_est, res.theta      # effects + learned enrichment coefficients
```

A ridge penalty on the non-intercept coefficients keeps it stable with many
collinear annotations; the intercept absorbs the global `p`. In simulation the
sampler **recovers the enrichment of an informative annotation (θ≈+1) and
correctly ignores an irrelevant one (θ≈0)** — so, unlike a *fixed* bad prior, a
learned one automatically down-weights unhelpful annotations (no "garbage-in"
penalty), and the learned θ are directly interpretable as functional-enrichment
estimates.

**Update the map every sweep (`theta_every=1`, the default).** The `θ`-update
and the effect sweep are coupled — `θ` sets the per-SNP `p_j` the sweep uses, and
the sweep's posterior inclusion probabilities feed the next `θ`-update — so they
must co-adapt. With a *lazy* update (e.g. `theta_every=10`) the map lags the
chain and, at low per-SNP power with large `m`, settles at an inflated global `p`
(it reads the prior-smeared inclusion probabilities of null SNPs as signal),
which **over-shrinks** the effects: in the architecture benchmark this made
`annot` fall *below* plain `auto` at N=10k (enriched 0.60 vs 0.64). Updating `θ`
every sweep removes the lag — the learned enrichment reaches its true value and
`annot` recovers to ≥ `auto` everywhere (see
[benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md)). The IRLS step is an `O(m·K²)` solve, so it is
negligible for a handful of annotations; raise `theta_every` only when `K` is
large enough (≳50) that the per-sweep `θ` cost rivals the effect sweep.

Two further options complete the SBayesRC picture:

* **`learn_variance=True`** additionally learns an annotation → effect-*variance*
  map `σ²_j ∝ exp(a_jᵀφ)` (returned in `.phi` / `.variance_enrichment`). Being
  learned, `φ` collapses to ~0 when effect size is annotation-independent (no
  harm) and turns positive when functional SNPs carry larger effects.
* **`ldpred3_auto_annot_blocks`** is the genome-wide streaming version: the maps
  are global but the effect sweeps run one LD block at a time, so the
  genome-wide LD is never materialised (it matches the dense version on
  block-diagonal LD). This is what the pipeline's `--method annot` uses.

## lassosum2 — penalised regression (`method="lassosum2"`)

`lassosum2` is not a Bayesian sampler: it minimises a **penalised least-squares**
objective directly on the summary statistics (Mak 2017; Privé 2021),

```
argmin_β   (1−s)·βᵀRβ − 2·β̂ᵀβ + s·‖β‖² + 2λ·‖β‖₁
```

where `R` is the block LD, `β̂` the standardized marginal effects, `s ∈ (0,1]` is
an LD-shrinkage that blends `R` toward the identity, and `λ` is the L1 penalty
that drives a **sparse** solution (many exact zeros). It is solved by
coordinate descent, warm-started down a log-spaced `λ` path from `λ_max = max|β̂|`
(all-zero) so the whole path is cheap.

**No validation cohort needed.** The `(s, λ)` grid is scored by
**pseudo-validation** — a correlation between the candidate effects and the
summary statistics that estimates out-of-sample fit from the sumstats + LD alone
— and the best cell is returned (guarded so a degenerate over-fit score ≤ 1
cannot win). It is a fast, MCMC-free, sparse complement to `auto`: no single
method dominates every architecture, so fitting both and keeping the better
pseudo-validation is cheap insurance. Dense LD blocks only. CLI:
`--method lassosum2`; API: `lassosum2(blocks, beta_hat)` → `Lassosum2Result`.

## Laplace prior — the Bayesian lasso (`method="laplace"`)

The lasso (`lassosum2`) is the posterior *mode* under a Laplace (double-
exponential) prior on the effects; `ldpred3_laplace` samples the posterior
**mean** of that same prior — the proper Bayesian shrinkage estimator, generally
a better predictor than the mode. It is the Bayesian counterpart of `lassosum2`.

It uses the normal / exponential scale-mixture representation of the Laplace
(Park & Casella 2008): a per-SNP latent scale `τ_j²` with

```
β_j | τ_j²  ~  N(0, τ_j²)         τ_j²  ~  Exponential(λ²/2)   =>   β_j ~ Laplace(λ)
```

so each Gibbs sweep is the *same* Gaussian per-SNP conditional the point-normal
sampler already runs (prior variance `τ_j²` instead of the slab), plus an
Inverse-Gaussian draw for `1/τ_j² ~ InvGauss(λ/|β_j|, λ²)`. The estimate is the
Rao-Blackwellised average of the per-SNP conditional means over the post-burn-in
sweeps.

**Setting `λ` (a plug-in, not EM).** The global shrinkage is a plug-in from the
heritability, `λ = √(2k/h²)` — the value that makes the Laplace prior's total
variance equal `h²`. Genome-wide, `h²` is estimated **once** by LD Score
regression (`ldpred3_by_blocks` / `--method laplace` do this when no `h²` is
given), which is robust across power regimes. Two data-adaptive schemes were
tried and rejected: a fully-Bayesian conditional Gamma draw drifts to the
hyper-prior's mean independently of the data; and a marginal-maximisation (EM)
update `λ² = 2k/Στ_j²` works at high power but has a positive-feedback failure at
low signal-to-noise — the `τ_j²` inflate on noise, so `λ` shrinks and the fit
overfits (`laplace` fell *below* the raw marginal at 1M SNPs). The plug-in
anchors the total prior variance to `h²` regardless of the fit, so it is stable.
`sample_lambda=True` still exposes the EM for the high-power regime. (See
[benchmarks](benchmarks.md#laplace-prior-the-bayesian-lasso-methodlaplace).)

Unlike the spike-and-slab there is no point mass at zero, so the posterior mean
is **dense** — heavier-tailed shrinkage than the infinitesimal Gaussian, but it
cannot concentrate on a few causals the way the point-normal does. It matches
`inf` on a truly infinitesimal trait and beats `lassosum2` **at moderate/high
power** (the mean over the mode) — but the ordering flips at low power
(genome-scale, fixed N), where `lassosum2`'s sparsity wins because the dense mean
cannot zero the null SNPs; and it trails `auto`/`grid` on sparse traits. Dense LD
blocks only (per-block, like `inf`/`grid`). CLI: `--method laplace`.

## Bivariate (two-trait) LDpred3

`ldpred3_auto_bivariate` jointly fits **two traits that share one LD reference**.
Each variant takes one of **four** states — causal for neither trait, trait 1
only, trait 2 only, or **both** — with probabilities `(π₀₀, π₁₀, π₀₁, π₁₁)`. A
trait-1-causal effect is `N(0, s₁)`, a trait-2-causal one `N(0, s₂)`, and a
*both*-causal pair is `N(0, Σ)` with `Σ = [[s₁, s₁₂],[s₁₂, s₂]]`; the
off-diagonal `s₁₂` is the genetic covariance and the only place the traits
couple. Each Gibbs step evaluates the four bivariate-Gaussian likelihoods of the
residual estimate, samples a state, and draws the effects; `π` and `s₁₂` are
re-estimated each sweep, and `r_g = β₁ᵀRβ₂ / √(h²₁h²₂)` is reported.

```python
from ldpred3 import ldpred3_auto_bivariate
res = ldpred3_auto_bivariate(corr, beta_hat1, beta_hat2, n1, n2)
res.beta1_est, res.beta2_est      # adjusted effects for the two traits
res.h2, res.rg                    # (h2_1, h2_2) and the genetic correlation
```

**Why per-trait states (and not one shared causal indicator).** An earlier
prototype used a single shared indicator (both traits causal at the same SNPs).
That helps when the assumption holds but **hurts** badly when it doesn't — with
disjoint causal variants it forced sharing and dropped the weak trait's accuracy
by ~0.1. The four-state model *learns* whether causal variants co-occur (`π₁₁`),
so disjoint traits drive `π₁₁ → 0` and the joint fit reduces to the independent
ones. Two further safeguards keep it honest: each trait's slab variance is capped
by its own **univariate** heritability (the weak trait's variance is otherwise
under-identified and inflates by borrowing from the strong one), and the variance
updates are damped.

The benchmark is **realistic**: the GWAS is generated from the true population
(coalescent) LD but fitted with an LD matrix estimated from a finite reference
panel (`Nref=2000`). For a genuinely under-powered trait 2 (N=2000, polygenic)
vs a well-powered trait 1 (N=100000), the gain grows with `r_g` and there is **no
harm** at low `r_g` or disjoint architectures:

| architecture | trait-2 alone | trait-2 joint | gain | r_g est |
|--------------|--------------:|--------------:|-----:|--------:|
| shared, r_g=0.0 | 0.641 | 0.636 | −0.005 | +0.02 |
| shared, r_g=0.3 | 0.647 | 0.641 | −0.006 | +0.39 |
| shared, r_g=0.6 | 0.655 | 0.694 | +0.039 | +0.67 |
| shared, r_g=0.9 | 0.658 | 0.830 | **+0.173** | +0.89 |
| disjoint causal | 0.630 | 0.610 | −0.020 | −0.08 |

The benefit is **real and large only where it should be** — a weak trait highly
correlated with a strong one — and negligible otherwise. It scales with how
under-powered trait 2 is: at N=1000 the rg=0.9 gain reaches ~+0.28, while for an
already well-powered trait 2 there is little to borrow and a small overhead, so
use the joint fit to boost an under-powered trait. (An earlier "fit with the true
LD" benchmark overstated the gains — they shrink markedly under realistic
reference-panel LD.) `ldpred3_auto_bivariate_blocks` is the streaming genome-wide
version; both GWAS must use the same LD/ancestry, and sample overlap is handled
via `cross_corr` (default 0). Regenerate with `benchmarks/bivariate_demo.py`.

**Genetic correlation vs bivariate LDSC.** The reported `r_g` has an independent
cross-check in `ldsc_rg` (cross-trait LD Score regression). Under the same
realistic reference-panel LD both are roughly unbiased from the same summary
statistics; bivariate LDpred3 is ~2× more precise (it uses the full LD
likelihood):

| true r_g | bivariate LDSC | bivariate LDpred3 |
|---------:|---------------:|------------------:|
| 0.0 | −0.04 ± 0.24 | −0.01 ± 0.15 |
| 0.3 | 0.29 ± 0.18 | 0.30 ± 0.16 |
| 0.6 | 0.59 ± 0.15 | 0.60 ± 0.13 |
| 0.9 | 0.86 ± 0.07 | 0.90 ± 0.04 |

(With the *true* LD the SEs are several-fold smaller and LDpred3's precision edge
larger; the reference-panel mismatch is what makes both noisier and narrows the
gap — the realistic picture.) Regenerate with
`benchmarks/compare_bivariate_rg.py`.

## Robustness: `allow_jump_sign`

`ldpred3_grid` / `ldpred3_auto` / `ldpred3_auto_infer` accept
`allow_jump_sign` (default `True`). Setting it `False` forbids a variant's
effect from flipping sign within a single Gibbs step (a sampled effect of the
opposite sign to the current one is set to zero instead). On noisy or
ill-conditioned LD this is a major source of divergence, and the guard — as in
the LDpred2-auto inference workflow (Privé et al.) — keeps the chain bounded.
It is exact for well-behaved problems (no flips occur) and only bites when the
sampler would otherwise oscillate.

The guard is honoured on every model path, including the **streaming** genome-wide
auto (`ldpred3_by_blocks(global_hyper=True)` and `--infer` on per-block / banded /
low-rank LD), so it is available at genome scale where ill-conditioned reference
LD makes it most useful — not just on a single dense block.

## Performance & Numba

The Gibbs sampler maintains a running `R @ beta` vector (per-SNP residual is an
O(1) lookup; the O(m) rank-1 update is only paid when an effect changes), so it
scales sub-quadratically in block size for sparse traits. The rank-1 update is
the bandwidth-bound hot path, so it runs as a fused element loop over a
**single-precision** LD row (float32 halves the memory traffic, ~2× faster, with
no meaningful accuracy cost — and matches bigsnpr, which also stores LD in single
precision). The effects and the `R @ beta` accumulator stay in float64.

The per-SNP point-normal scalars are **hoisted out of the inner loop** when they
are constant across variants. With a shared sample size `N` (a scalar `n_eff`)
and a uniform slab/prior, the posterior variance, its `sqrt`, the
half-log-normaliser and the log prior-odds are identical for every SNP, so they
are computed **once per sweep** (`_pn_const_scalars`) rather than re-deriving a
`sqrt`/`log1p` per SNP. This is the same hoist the batched/streaming kernels use;
it is now in the dense, sampling and sparse single-block kernels too. It is
**bit-identical** to the per-SNP path (same arithmetic, same RNG stream) and
falls back to it whenever `N` varies per variant, a MAF slab (`alpha`) is set, or
`prior_weights` are non-uniform. The win is largest for sparse traits — when few
effects change per sweep the O(m) rank-1 update is mostly skipped, so the per-SNP
scalars would otherwise dominate the sweep (see
[benchmarks](benchmarks.md#constant-n-sampler-fast-path)).

The [Rao–Blackwellised estimate](#the-point-normal-model-and-its-gibbs-sampler)
(accumulating `E[beta_j | rest] = P(causal) · posterior_mean` each sweep instead
of the sampled draw) is also where the sampler earns its efficiency: the sampled
value still drives the Markov chain, but the *estimate* uses the expectation,
which has much lower Monte-Carlo variance (≈6–13× in fast-mixing regimes), so
fewer iterations reach the same accuracy. In extreme-LD regions the benefit is
smaller because chain mixing, not sampling noise, is the bottleneck.

[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is strongly recommended: when installed, the
inner sampler is JIT-compiled (and cached) for a large speed-up. Without it the
code still runs and gives identical results, but the sampler falls back to plain
Python loops and is much slower — fine for small problems / CI, not for
genome-wide runs.

### Reproducibility

The Gibbs samplers are seeded and deterministic, but the **LD construction and
the inference post-processing use BLAS** (`Z.T @ Z`, the dense matmuls, `eigh`),
whose results can differ in the last bits across BLAS thread counts. For
bit-reproducible LD / r² across machines, pin the threads before running:

```bash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
```

(the test suite sets these for exactly this reason). The Gibbs effect estimates
themselves are reproducible from the seed regardless.
